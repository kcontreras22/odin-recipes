  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>It is rare to find a person that does not like chocolate chip cookies,
    but they do exist. With this recipe, it is possible for them to finally see the light.
  <div>
    This chocolate chip cookie recipe is best for those that <em>love</em> big and chewy cookies!
    You will have to be patient though - the dough will need to chill (preferably overnight) for the best results!

  <h3>Ingredients (yields ~ 11)</h3>
  <ul>
    Wet Ingredients
    <li>1/2 Cup - Unsalted Butter</li>
    <li>1 - Large Egg</li>
    <li>3/4 Cup - Light Brown Sugar, Packed</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup - Granulated Sugar</li>
    <br> Dry Ingredients
    <li>1 2/3 Cup - All-Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp - Cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 tsp - Baking Soda</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp - Salt</li>
    <li>1 Cup - Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Prep:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat <strong>butter</strong> on high-power to melt, about 1 minute or 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add the <strong>egg, sugar, vanilla</strong> to the bowl with the melted <strong>butter</strong>
      and whisk to combine.</li>
    <li>Add <strong>flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt</strong> and stir to combine.
      Dough may seem crumbly, that's OK.</li>
    <li>Add the <strong>chocolate chips</strong> and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Use a large cookie scoop or a 1/4 Cup measuring cup, form 11-12 sized mounds of dough,
      roll into balls, place on cookie sheet and flatten halfway.</li>
    <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for <em>at least</em> 4 hours. Preferably overnight. :) </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Baking:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pre-heat oven to 350Â°F</li>
    <li>Make sure mounds are at least 2 inches apart</li>
    <li>Bake for about 12-14 minutes (if your cookies looks small, reduce baking time)
      or until edges have set. Even if slightly under-baked, pale, don't overbake. The cookies
      will firm up as they cool.</li>
  </ul>
